    "a) Writes two python functions that encode and decode a text using the Caesar cipher. The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher in which each letter of the plain text is substituted with a letter found by moving n places down the alphabet. For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is apparently named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his officials. Caesar ciphers can use any integer value as a shift.\\\n",

    "HINT: Dynamic programming involves iterating all possible scenarios without recursion. Start by thinking of way to climb a single stair, then 2, then n > 2. The next solution at step n is always related to the computations at step n-1."
