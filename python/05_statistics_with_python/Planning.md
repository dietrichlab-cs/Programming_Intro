# Fun With ~~Flags~~ Stats

## NOTEBOOK: Motivation with Example
- Create a Dataset of Cellviability of 2 different drugs on cancer cells. 
We want to know if the drugs are significantly different from a control group.

## NOTEBOOK: Descriptive Statistics: Repetition of Pandas and Seaborn for Data Exploration
- Print Mean, Std, Median, Min, Max, Count, 25%, 50%, 75% for each drug and control group.
- Plot the distribution of the data for each drug and control group.
- Plot the boxplot of the data for each drug and control group.

## NOTEBOOK: Hypothesis Testing: Repetition of Hypothesis Testing with Python
- Perform a Welch's t-test for each drug against the control group.
- Effect size calculation for each drug against the control group.

## Notebook: Multiple Hypothesis Testing
- Show an example that demonstrates the problem of multiple hypothesis testing and how to correct it.
- Perform a Bonferroni correction for the example.
- Perform a Benjamini-Hochberg correction for the example.
- Compare the results of the corrections.
- Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the corrections.

## Notebook: Linear Regression and Correlation
- Create a dataset of the cellviability of 2 different drugs on cancer cells and the concentration of the drugs.
- Perform a linear regression for each drug.
- Calculate the correlation between the cellviability and the concentration of the drugs.
- Discuss the results.
- Plot the regression line and the scatter plot of the data.
