This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

## Operations

```{r}
# standard arithmetic + - * /
6 / 2
```

```{r}
# order of operations
4*4+4
```

```{r}
# some division magic

# regular division
5 / 2

# whole number division
5 %/% 2

# whole number remainder of division
5 %% 2
```

## Datatypes and Variables

```{r}
# assign a variable
x <- 5
```

```{r}
# datatypes
# numeric
x <- 5
x
# character
x = "String"
x
# boolean (logical)
x <- TRUE
x
```

```{r}
# operations on datatypes
x <- String" + "5"
x
```

```{r}
# not all operations between datatypes work
x = "String" + 5
x
```

```{r}
# Operations on variables
x <- 5
y <- 9
z <- x + y
z
```

## Functions

```{r}
# declare a function
addition <- function(x,y) {
  return(x + y)
}
```

```{r}
# use the function
addition(2, 5)
```

```{r}
# functions dont need to return anything
addition_no_output <- function(x,y) {
  print(x + y)
}
addition_no_output(5, 2)
```

### build in functions

```{r}
# print output to the console
print("Hello World")

# mathematical functions. Functions can be chained
print(max(3, 5))
```

## Collections (vectors, lists, etc.)

```{r}
# Vector of strings (all elements are of same type, pretty much a list)
list_of_numbers <- c(1,2,3,3)
list_of_numbers

# c for custom elements
c(1,2,3,3)
# rep for repeating elements
rep(1, times=4)
# seq for sequence of elements
seq(1, 10, by=2)
```

```{r}
# operations on vectors

# length
length(list_of_numbers)

# access element
list_of_numbers[1]

# slice of list
list_of_numbers[seq(2, length(list_of_numbers))]

# change element
list_of_numbers[1] <- 10
list_of_numbers
```

```{r}
# lists can contain multiple datatypes
list_of_stuff <- list(1, "Test", TRUE)
list_of_stuff
```

```{r}
# access elements -> double brackets return element on its own, single brackets return element as list
list_of_stuff[1]
list_of_stuff[[1]]
```

## Logic

```{r}
# equality
5 == 5
5 == "5"
5 != "5"
```

```{r}
# logical operators
statement1 <- 3 < 5
statement2 <- 3 > 5

print(statement1 && statement2)
print(statement1 || statement2)
```

```{r}
# order of logical operators and brackets
print(!(TRUE && FALSE))
```

```{r}
# control flow
x <- 5
if (x >= 3) {
  print("X is larger or equals to 3")
} else {
  print("X is smaller than 3") 
}
```

```{r}
# chaining if statements
x <- 5
if (x > 3) {
  print("X is larger than 3")
} else if (x == 3) {
  print("X equals 3") 
} else {
  print("X is smaller than 3") 
}
```

## Loops

```{r}
# vector from early: 
list_of_numbers

# for-each loop
for (value in list_of_numbers) {
  print(paste(c("List contains value", value), collapse = " "))
}
```

```{r}
# for-i loop
for(i in 1:length(list_of_numbers)) {
  print(paste(c("List contains value", list_of_numbers[i]), collapse = " "))
}
```

```{r}
# while loop
counter <- 0
while (counter < 10) {
  print(paste(c("Iteration", counter), collapse = " "))
  counter <- counter + 1
}
```

## DataFrames

```{r}
# DataFrames -> named columns matrix
Data_Frame <- data.frame (
  Sample = c("Sample1", "Sample2", "Sample3"),
  Counts = c(100, 150, 120),
  Quality = c(60, 30, 45)
)

Data_Frame

# summarized the dataframe
summary(Data_Frame) 
```

```{r}
# access column by index
Data_Frame[1]

# access column by name
Data_Frame[["Sample"]]

# alternative access column by name
Data_Frame$Sample
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
