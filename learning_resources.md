# Learning Resources

This file contains all sorts of online resources for learning python and R. 
In the words of wikipedia: _This list is incomplete. You can help by expanding it._ 

For each resource you can find not only the link but also a short description on the covered topics. 

## General

### Solving problems

#### Google

Although nearly superseded by ChatGPT and other LLMs, Google is still a great resource to quickly look up websites which relate to your problem.

#### StackOverflow

When you have ever had a longer conversation with a programmer, then you will have heard at least one of the following sentences:

_There is no programming problem that someone hasn't already posted to StackOverflow._ 

_I just copy-pasted some code from StackOverflow and now the problem is magically solved._

SO: Use [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) to your advantage. If you google a problem and there is a post from StackOverflow popping up, definitely have a look at it. 
The quality of answer is often times very high as answers will get edited and improved by lots of smart people. 

You can also post a question there. Ideally stating that you tried something so obviously wrong, that people simply have to answer and correct you.

#### ChatGPT

If Google and StackOverflow sound too old-school for you. Just use ChatGPT. 
It's just insane how good the answers are. 

BUT: You need to describe your problem appropriately. Don't just type in your Google search term, input parts of your code, specify the problem. 

### Exercising your skills

No amount of reading can make you a good programmer. You need to just program. 
You could try some easy problems related to your research but there are also online websites with interesting problems. 

#### AdventOfCode

Link: [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/)

Each year there is an advent calendar with one programming problem per day and a nice story. You can replay previous years as well. 

#### Simple Programming Problems GitHub

Link: [Simple Programming Problems](https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html)

A TA for introductory computer science classes has compiled a list of simple small problems that you can work through and be inspired by. They are classified in different levels and are very beginner friendly. 

## Python

### Cheat Sheets and Docs

#### Learn X in Y minutes

Link: [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/)

Description: Great overview on python syntax and datatypes. You can try to follow it as a beginner, but we would rather recommend this site to people who are already familiar with programming. 

#### Python Cheatsheet

Link: [Python Cheatsheet](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/)

Description: Short and concise documentation of basics and regular problems you will encounter during programming. It's a nice resource if you are searching for some specific information (e.g. how to read in a file) 

#### Python, Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib docs

Link: [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/) \
Link: [Numpy Docs](https://numpy.org/doc/) \
Link: [Pandas Docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) \
Link: [Matplotlib Docs](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html)

Description: Documentations for python and the most frequently used libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib). These should be the first point if you search for specifics on a certain function or class. Most tutorials will also link to the official docs for all the specifics. This is just a selection, but in general all larger packages come with an online documentation.

### Tutorials

#### Official Python Tutorial

Link: [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)

Description: Complete tutorial on all the functionalities offered by python. There is a lot in here, so go through the index and look for topics which might interest you. 

#### W3 Schools Python Tutorial

Link: [Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)

Description: A nice tutorial on the basics with short exercise questions at the end of a "lesson". It also touches on some very useful libraries like numpy, pandas and scipy and goes into detail on visualisations with matplotlib.
Definitely a recommended resource if you never programmed and want a fine-grained step-by-step tutorial.

## R

### Cheat Sheets and Docs

#### Learn X in Y minutes

Link: [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/r/)

Description: Great overview on R syntax and datatypes. You can try to follow it as a beginner, but we would rather recommend this site to people who are already familiar with programming. 

#### Python Cheatsheet

Link: [R Cheatsheet](https://iqss.github.io/dss-workshops/R/Rintro/base-r-cheat-sheet.pdf)

Description: Very short but nicely organized overview on the most important R concepts. It does also cover some very common functions/statistical methods that you will use fairly often. A good thing to have open on the second monitor while working with the more complex datatypes like matrices and dataframes. 

#### Official manuals

Link: [R manual](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html)

Description: There are actual manual for R available as HTML or PDF documents (or physical copies if you want some evening reading). The main document is "An introduction to R" ([Link](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf)). 
It does contain pretty much everything you ever need to know about R and its functions, but it definitely lacks some quality-of-life features that other docs have. 

### Tutorials

#### CSAMA labs

Link: [CSAMA lab repository](https://github.com/Bioconductor/CSAMA-labs)

Description: The CSAMA lab repository contains condensed and to-the-point R notebooks on not just the basics of R but also many bioinformatics related libraries in the BioConductoR environment. The labs are definetly advanced, but with the help of ChatGPT for example, it should be no problem to understand all the steps taken. 
The focus is less on the programming basics and more on the statistical usage of R.  

#### r-statistics.co

Link: [R Statistics](https://r-statistics.co/)

Description: A very elaborate collection of tutorials from the basics of R, visualizations with ggplot2, to statistical foundations and advanced statistical methods. This is a borderline statistics lecture in the later chapters but especially the R and ggplot2 tutorials can be a huge help in understanding how to leverage them for your problems.

#### W3 Schools Python Tutorial

Link: [R Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/r/)

Description: A nice tutorial on the basics with lots of examples. It does not cover external libraries, but you might not even need them if you truly explore everything R has to offer natively. Covered are topics from statistics to visualization.
Definitely a recommended resource if you never programmed and want a fine-grained step-by-step tutorial.
